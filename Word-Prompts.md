1. Cross-Browser Testing
Problem Statement: Create a GitHub Actions workflow to ensure that your web application works correctly across different browsers. The workflow should run tests on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Use a matrix strategy to run the tests in parallel across these browsers.

2. Testing with Different Database Versions
Problem Statement: Develop a GitHub Actions workflow to test your application against different versions of MySQL. The workflow should run tests on MySQL versions 5.7 and 8.0. Use a matrix strategy to run the tests in parallel across these database versions.

3. Testing with Different Configurations
Problem Statement: Design a GitHub Actions workflow to test your application with different feature flags such as true/false. The workflow should run tests with the feature flag enabled and disabled. Use a matrix strategy to run the tests in parallel with these configurations.

4. Testing with Different Python Versions
Problem Statement: Create a GitHub Actions workflow to ensure that your Python application works with different versions of Python. The workflow should run tests on Python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Use a matrix strategy to run the tests in parallel across these Python versions.

5. Testing with Different Compiler Versions
Problem Statement: Design a GitHub Actions workflow to test your C/C++ application with different compiler versions. The workflow should build and run tests using GCC versions 7, 8, and 9, as well as Clang versions 7 and 8. Use a matrix strategy to run the tests in parallel across these compiler versions.

6. Create a CI/CD workflow file that will:
Trigger on push and pull requests to main branch, as well as a manual trigger
Run on linux version v2.321.0
Install and run npm tests and builds
Deploy to dev, staging, and prod in sequence
Uses an api key for the deployment environments
